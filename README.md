This is only a proof that it works, I use it myself and it's made just for me, so you will have to change alot. you will have to install chrome and tampermonkey, update your username at the top of the python script, then create a new script in tampermonkey with the code from scraper.js

I changed my chrome download path to a specific folder instead of downloads.

I'm not going to help you on this unless I know you, so if your having issues, make sure you update all paths
